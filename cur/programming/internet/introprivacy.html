    <h3>Principles of Social Media Privacy<br>
    </h3>
    People share common misconceptions about the Internet because they
    don't know how the Internet really works. This comes especially to
    light during the use of social networking services, such as
    Facebook. Many frequent users of social-networking sites do not have
    a full understanding of the potential consequences their current
    online activities might have later in their lives. For example, a
    Facebook posting that a friend thinks is cool might be seen by a
    much larger audience than expected--including perhaps future
    employers who wouldn&#8217;t think it was so cool. In addition, not
    understanding--or not thinking about--the consequences of posting
    often leads to oversharing information about other people, including
    friends and relatives.<br>
    <br>
    A site that summarizes important rules about Internet and social
    media use is the <a target="_blank" _target="new"
      href="http://teachingprivacy.icsi.berkeley.edu">http://teachingprivacy.icsi.berkeley.edu</a>
    page. We invite you to browse around and experiment. Be sure to
    watch some of the videos on the site as well!<br>
    <br>
    Can you think of other privacy issues other than the 10 principles?
    Discuss and provide <a href="mailto:info@teachingprivacy.com">feedback</a>
    on the website!<br>
    <br>
    Then, discuss the following questions with your peers. You can use
    the Internet to get any information you need. Think of it as a
    scavanger hunt. Write your answers down in the <a target="new"
href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Gvz7ksamBR3v_YKlu_UMN8IbJzKjkyoOvE9BgEwFRSY/viewform">Google
      Form</a> or on paper:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>What is an information footprint? How would you measure the
        size of your information footprint?</li>
      <li>What are cookies and what do they do? Why do they matter for
        anonymity questions?</li>
      <li>Why would it matter who sees your information on the Internet,
        as long as you&#8217;re not doing anything wrong?</li>
      <li>When you send a message over a network, how does it get from
        your device to the recipient&#8217;s device?</li>
      <li>What&#8217;s the difference between <em>private</em> communication
        and <em>secure</em> communication?</li>
      <li>Who has the rights to your information? To your email? Your
        Facebook/Twitter/Instagram posts? Files you have stored in the
        cloud?</li>
      <li>How is passing information around on the Internet like the
        party game Telephone? How is it different?</li>
      <li>Can websites and online services make copies of your
        information without asking you? How do you know if they&#8217;ve
        duplicated it?</li>
      <li>If you don&#8217;t actively <em>use</em> the Internet, does that
        mean you&#8217;re not <em>on</em> the Internet?</li>
      <li>Can you tell if a Facebook or Twitter account with the name of
        a celebrity is really them? How many Paris Hiltons are there on
        Twitter? <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Hidden Metadata</h3>
    When you post on the Internet, you're often sharing not only the
    content of your posts, but <a
href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/interactive/2013/jun/12/what-is-metadata-nsa-surveillance#meta=0000000"
      target="_blank">metadata</a> like geolocation (GPS tags) and time
    stamps associated with those posts. Your information footprint
    includes all that metadata, as well as inferences that can be drawn
    by putting all the information together. The Ready or Not
    application was created to help you visualize how part of your
    footprint--the geolocation information and time stamps associated
    with posts on social media like Twitter, Instagram, and
    Facebook--could be used to find you in the physical world.<br>

    and<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Test it on one of the suggested celebrities, such as <span
          style="font-style: italic;">stevewoz</span>.</li>
      <li>Test it on somebody else you know.</li>
      <li>Discuss with your peers what consequences could arrise from
        having location and time metadata publicly available.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3> Geolocation based on your IP address</h3>
    The IP address that your ISP assigns to you contains information about your location. Let's take a look at <b>your</b> IP address: <span id='user_ip_address' name='user_ip_address'></span>.
        <br/>
        It seems that you're located in <b><span id="user_city_name"></span>, <span id="user_region_name"></span></b>. In fact, let's see if we can zoom in to your location on a map!
